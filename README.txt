Shiva Mudide:
I wrote our heuristic function, boardscore, and n-ply minimax functions. 

James Wei:
James wrote our heuristic function with me and our 2-ply minimax function. He also helped out with the other functions. 





We first only had basic heuristic function for a depth of 1. Our boardscore function also only weighted the most recent move made. We then wrote a 2-ply minimax function for a depth of 2. We updated boardscore to weight all the squares on the board. Finally we wrote an  n-ply minimax function. We have the depth set at 5 for the tournament. We think this will be a good strategy because our bot will be able to make the best move given a time constraint.
